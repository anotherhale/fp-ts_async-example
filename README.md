FP-TS Async-Example (read file/parse yaml asynchronously)

Learning FP-TS and trying to work with some real world examples.

This project is my experimentation with `FP-TS` asychronous `Task`.  I was able to successfully work with a synchronous version of this project here: https://github.com/anotherhale/fp-ts_sync-example. I would like any feedback or help with this version of the project.

`npm run build`

`npm run start `

Resulting application output:
```
{ _tag: 'Right', right: Promise { <pending> } }
```
